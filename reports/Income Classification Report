# Income Classification Report

## 📄 Executive Summary
This project aims to predict an individual's income category (\'>50K\' or \<=50K\') based on demographic attributes. The project utilized diverse machine learning algorithms and advanced data preprocessing techniques to achieve high prediction accuracy. Insights from the analysis can support socio-economic research and HR analytics.

## 🔍 Methodologies

### **1. Data Collection and Cleaning**
- **Dataset Source**: [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/adult).
- Missing values were addressed using techniques like replacing with most frequent or \"unknown\" categories.
- Replaced '?' with NaN for clean analysis.

### **2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- Analyzed the distribution of demographic attributes such as age, education, occupation, and income levels.
- Visualized the correlation between features and income.
- Noted significant trends, such as higher education levels correlating with higher income.

### **3. Data Preprocessing**
- Categorical features were one-hot encoded.
- Numerical features were scaled to a [0, 1] range.
- Addressed class imbalance using:
  - **Over-sampling**: SMOTE, ADASYN
  - **Under-sampling**: NearMiss, Tomek Links
  - **Algorithmic Techniques**: Class weight adjustments in models.

### **4. Feature Selection and Clustering**
- Utilized **Random Forest Classifier** for feature importance ranking.
- Performed **K-Means Clustering** to identify patterns within data.

### **5. Modeling Approaches**
Implemented multiple classifiers:
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- Support Vector Classification (SVC)
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Gaussian Naive Bayes
- Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA)
- AdaBoost
- Gradient Boosting
- Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP)

### **6. Evaluation Metrics**
- **Accuracy**: Correct predictions ratio.
- **Precision & Recall**: Evaluated the positive prediction quality.
- **F1-Score**: Harmonic mean of precision and recall.
- **ROC-AUC Score**: Assessed classification model performance.

---

## 📊 Results & Insights
- **Random Forest** and **Gradient Boosting** emerged as top-performing models.
- Over-sampling with **SMOTE** improved model recall.
- Key features influencing income prediction included:
  - **Education Level**
  - **Hours Worked Per Week**
  - **Age**
  - **Capital Gain**

- Visual analyses showed a strong correlation between higher education levels and income categories.
- Resampling methods significantly mitigated the class imbalance challenge, leading to better prediction accuracy.
